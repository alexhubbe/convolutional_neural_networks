The [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 10-class dataset) is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) categorized into 10 

classes:
Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.

Each class has 6,000 images, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. Due to its small size and diversity, CIFAR-10 is commonly used for developing and evaluating deep learning models, particularly in image classification tasks. Each class contains a variety of images representing the vehicles or animals from different angles, in various contexts and environments, making it a great dataset for testing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques.
